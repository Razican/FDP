# Remote robotic experiment integration in a game platform to promote STEM in young people #

Responding to the strong growing demand of new learning tools, a new learning experience is
presented, based on remote laboratories. This project tries to create what to the best of the
knowledge provided by the research conducted in this project will be the first game platform based
on remote laboratories. This will introduce young students between 10 and 18 years old to STEM
(Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in an enjoyable way.

The game platform will be divided in two main scenarios. The first of them will be a trivial type
game, where the user will be able to control a robot in a labyrinth and answer some questions
that will give points to the user. Winners will be given a prize. Moreover, in this scenario, a
psychological experiment will be performed, aiming to help in the fight against pseudoscience.

The second scenario will be a service in which the user will be able to program the robot from
a visual IDE (Integrated Development Environment). This will teach students the basics of pro-
gramming by letting them use blocks to program the robot and see the result.
