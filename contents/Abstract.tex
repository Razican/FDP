\chapter*{Abstract}

Responding to the strong growing demand of new learning tools, a new learning experience is
presented, based on remote laboratories. This project, tries to create what at our best knowledge
will be the first game platform based on remote laboratories to introduce young students between 10
and 18 years old to \acrshort{stem} (\acrlong{stem}) in an enjoyable way.

The game platform will be divided in two main scenarios. The first of them will be a trivial type
game, where the user will be able to control a robot in a labyrinth and answer some questions that
will give points to the user. Winners will be given a prize. Moreover, in this scenario, a
psychology experiment will be performed, aiming to help in the fight against pseudoscience.

The second scenario will be a service in which the user will be able to program the robot from a
visual \acrshort{ide} (\acrlong{ide}). This will teach students the basics of programming by letting
them use blocks to program the robot and see the result.
