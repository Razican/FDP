I would like to thank the following people, since without them this project would not have been
possible. Thanks to them I was able to life this amazing experience.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{My mum, Arantza}, for dedicating her last days of her life to support me when I
	was starting my first months of my degree, and in overall, for being the best mother any
	kid could dream of.

	\item \textbf{My dad, Manu}, for being patient with me all these years and giving me the
	opportunity to continue my studies by giving me moral and financial support.

	\item \textbf{Javier García Zubía}, for being the tutor of this project and for giving me the
	opportunity to learn while working in WebLab-Deusto for the last two years.

	\item \textbf{Pablo Garaizar}, for recommending me to Javier García Zubía as a
	potential candidate to work in WebLab-Deusto.

	\item \textbf{Gabriel Martinez}, for having him in Weblab-Deusto and for being a good co-worker.
	His contributions to the AI of the robot were priceless.

	\item \textbf{Pablo Orduña}, for letting me understand \textit{his} WebLab-Deusto and helping me
	each time I had issues in my development.

	\item \textbf{Luis Rodríguez}, for being incredibly patient with all my questions, that were not
	few.
