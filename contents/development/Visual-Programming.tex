\section{Visual Programming}

The second part of this project is to develop a visual programming interface to program the robot
and test the programming skills of the users. Since the hardware platform for this section has been
the same as for the trivial type game, hardware requirements are not included in this section.
Furthermore, since the same software design is followed for the communication with the robot, there
is no need on adding it to this section.

We will therefore explain the software requirements for the visual programming client, the design
specification of the software that has been used for this section and the user manual for this
application, along with the issue management of this section, that will be mainly focused on the
software issues.

There is no need of explaining the testing plan, since it has been the same as the one used in the
trivial game, except from the real user testing, that we have not been able to do.
