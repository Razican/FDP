\section{Trivia Game}

The first modality of the game is a trivia-type game, that will use Romie, the robot in
WebLab-Deusto and its labyrinth to create an experience for learning general knowledge. Moreover,
since the trivia questions will be configurable, so that the game can be adapted.

\subsection{Software and Hardware Requirements}

This software will have tight requirements in terms of user-friendliness, communication stability
and security, since it must be developed using as far as possible current hardware and be easy to
use by young students. Moreover, since it will be presented in crowded events, it must support high
load and availability.

Furthermore, due to the requirements of the project, it must be integrated with the WebLab-Deusto
platform and must be deployable in that environment. Thus, the requirements specification will be
as it follows:

\subsubsection{Software requirements:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The software must be able to communicate with the robot.
	\item The software must be able to send control commands to the robot.
	\item The software must be able to receive command results from the robot.
	\item The software must be integrated in the WebLab-Deusto platform as a new experiment.
	\item The software must have an easy to use user interface based on human-computer interaction
	principles.
	\item The software must be stable enough to support tens of accesses per hour.
	\item The software must provide enough questions so that the user never finishes with them and
	can be randomly selected.
	\item The game must increase difficulty as the user gets more points.
	\item The game must finish in less than 15 minutes.
	\item A ranking must be provided after finishing the game for the user to know its ranking.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hardware requirements:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The hardware must be placed in WebLab-Deusto.
	\item The robot must never get blocked, so in the case of an incident it must be automatically
	recovered.
	\item The cameras must be accessible from the Internet.
	\item The robot must be controlled via Bluetooth.
	\item The robot must never run out of power.
	\item The robot must be able to read all the \acrshort{rfid} tags with at least 99~\% accuracy.
	\item The robot must use the current labyrinth in WebLab-Deusto.
	\item No new hardware can be added to the current WebLab server (Plunder).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Specification}

Taking into account the previous requirements, it has been decided to do a small hardware redesign
and a complete software design for the project. We will now see the hardware and software design
specifications.
