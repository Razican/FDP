\section{Trivial Type Game}

The first part of this project will be the development of a trivial type game that will use Romie,
the robot in WebLab-Deusto and its labyrinth to create an experience for learning general knowledge.
Moreover, the trivial type questions will be configurable, so that the game can be adapted.

In this section that development will be explained, firstly by analyzing the software and hardware
requirements. Then, the design specification for the hardware and the software will be shown, and
finally, the deployment considerations will be specified.

After that, the testing plan project will be analyzed and a user manual will be presented to learn
how to use the application, even though it should not be necessary thanks to the work in usability.

\subsection{Software and Hardware Requirements}

This software will have tight requirements in terms of user-friendliness, communication stability
and security, since it must be deployed using as far as possible current hardware and be easy to
use by young students. Moreover, since it will be presented in crowded events, it must support high
load and availability.

Furthermore, due to the requirements of the project, it must be integrated with the WebLab-Deusto
platform and must be deployable in that environment. Thus, the requirements specification will be
as it follows:

\subsubsection{Software requirements:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The software must be able to communicate with the robot.
	\item The software must be able to send control commands to the robot.
	\item The software must be able to receive command responses from the robot.
	\item The software must be integrated in the WebLab-Deusto platform as a new experiment.
	\item The software must have an easy to use \acrshort{ui} based on \acrlong{hci} or
	\acrshort{hci} principles.
	\item The software must be stable enough to support dozens of accesses per hour.
	\item The software must provide enough questions so that the user never finishes them and can be
	randomly selected.
	\item The game must increase difficulty as the user gets more points.
	\item The game must finish in less than 15 minutes.
	\item A ranking must be provided after finishing the game for the user to know its ranking.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hardware requirements:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The hardware must be placed in WebLab-Deusto.
	\item The robot must never get blocked, so in the case of an incident it must be automatically
	recovered.
	\item The cameras must be accessible from the Internet.
	\item The robot must be controlled via \acrlong{bt}.
	\item The robot must never run out of power.
	\item The robot must be able to read all the \acrshort{rfid} tags with at least 99~\% accuracy.
	\item The robot must use the current labyrinth in WebLab-Deusto.
	\item No new hardware can be added to the current WebLab server (Plunder).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Specification}

Taking into account the previous requirements, it has been decided to do a small hardware redesign
and a complete software design for the project. Now the hardware and software design specifications
will be shown.

\subsubsection{Hardware Specification}

Current robot is deployed with a simple \acrshort{rfid} (\acrlong{rfid}) reader
(model ID-12)~\cite{rfid}, which has shown some issues when reading the \acrshort{rfid} tags. For
that reason, it has been decided to use a new module, the model ID-20LA~\cite{rfid}
(figure~\ref{fig:rfid}). This will give the robot a much higher reliability when reading
\acrshort{rfid} tags.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.3\textheight, angle=-90]{fig/rfid}
	\caption{ID-20LA \acrshort{rfid} reader.}
	\label{fig:rfid}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, there is currently an issue with the availability of the robot. It is powered
with a 2Ah \acrshort{lipo} battery, and is recharged when needed. This has a big issue, since as we
have seen, in high load conditions would not meet the required availability, and furthermore, in
weekends or holidays, there would be no option to change and recharge the battery. Therefore it has
been decided to deploy a cable installation from the ceiling of the laboratory, and the design of
the robot has been adapted so that the cables do not get stuck in the labyrinth.

The rest of the robot will be used as it is, since it provides with the needed capabilities for the
needs of the project: It has a wall sensor capable of avoiding crashes with walls, infrared sensors
to detect the lines in the ground, motors and wheels capable of moving the robot, \acrlong{bt}
connection to communicate with it and an Arduino microcontroller, so that is easy to modify the
current firmware (figure~\ref{fig:bluetooth}).

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{fig/bluetooth}
	\caption{\acrlong{bt} module on top of the Arduino shield.}
	\label{fig:bluetooth}
\end{figure}

The robot is currently configured with a camera D-link DCS-932L that provides infrared vision if the
light is shut down and normal vision if not, and it can be accessed from Wi-Fi and
Ethernet~\cite{camera}. In this case it will be used via Wi-Fi, since the robot will be moving
around a big space with multiple physical obstacles.

\subsubsection{Software Specification}

The software in for this implementation will be divided modularly, thinking on scalability and
code reuse. The application must be built on top of WebLab-Deusto, so provided \acrshort{api}s will
be used as much as possible. Moreover, and due to deployment needs, the software will be divided
between the robot, an intermediate server and WebLab software. The flow chart for the experiment can
be seen in figure~\ref{fig:exp_flow}. This will be the user's flow in the application. In
figure~\ref{fig:layers} the software layers can be seen, each one with its functions.

\clearpage
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{fig/experiment-flow}
	\caption{Experiment flow chart.}
	\label{fig:exp_flow}
\end{figure}

\clearpage
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{fig/layers}
	\caption{Software layers showing each layer's functionality.}
	\label{fig:layers}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

The robot will use a slightly modified version of the current firmware, since it must not get
blocked by any wall in case of crash and a more reliable implementation is needed. That is why it
has been programmed to turn back if a hardware error occurs and collides with a wall. Nevertheless,
the external \acrlong{bt} \acrshort{api} will be the same as the one that was already implemented at
the beginning of the project:

It will provide an ``F'' command to go forward, that will return the \acrshort{rfid} tag if it finds
one, an ``L'' command to turn left, its counterpart ``R'' command to turn right and it will also
provide the command ``S'' that will check if there is a wall in front of the robot. Nevertheless,
and even if the experiment server can check for a wall, the robot itself has been programmed to
return a ``\acrshort{nak}'' response if it is commanded to go forward against a wall.

The robot itself works following the lines in the labyrinth until it finds an intersection. It is
also capable of turning in those intersections: if it is commanded to turn right, it will make a 90
degree right turn and face the path in its right. When the robot stops on top of an \acrshort{rfid}
tag, it will return the tag's label.

The intermediate server will provide a small \acrlong{rest} (\acrshort{rest}) \acrshort{api} in a
small Python server. Its only duty will be to provide a simple interface for the robot using
\acrshort{http} instead of \acrlong{bt}, needed due to deployment constraints. An example of
the \acrshort{api} usage in Python can be seen in algorithm~\ref{alg:romie_rest}.

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{.9\textwidth}
\singlespace
\fvset{frame=single}
\begin{pyglist}[language=python, caption={Romie \acrshort{rest} \acrshort{api} example.},
	label={alg:romie_rest}, listingname={Algorithm}, numbers=left]
import urllib2

# Go forward and get RFID tag if exists
tag = urllib2.urlopen('http://192.168.0.190:8000/f',
    timeout = 60).read()

# Left turn
result = urllib2.urlopen('http://192.168.0.190:8000/l',
    timeout = 60).read()

# Right turn
result = urllib2.urlopen('http://192.168.0.190:8000/r',
    timeout = 60).read()

# Check if there is a wall in front of the robot
result = urllib2.urlopen('http://192.168.0.190:8000/s',
    timeout = 60).read()
\end{pyglist}
\fvset{frame=none}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

This \acrshort{rest} \acrshort{api} is connected to the robot via \acrlong{bt} and sends commands
with the PyBluez \acrlong{bt} wrapper, as it can bee seen in algorithm~\ref{alg:rasp_bluetooth}.
This way, with the software layered, the development is not only faster and easier, but the product
is more scalable and modular.

Then, the experiment server required by the WebLab-Deusto architecture, will provide a WebLab
command \acrshort{api}, that will be callable by the client of the experiment. This server will be
developed in Python because the WebLab Python server libraries are better tested than other language
libraries. The data for the ranking will be stored in a SQLite 3 database. This database provides
all the needed \acrshort{acid} constraints (\acrlong{acid}) with a small \acrshort{sql}
(\acrlong{sql}) \acrlong{rdbms} (\acrshort{rdbms})~\cite{sqlite}.

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{.9\textwidth}
\singlespace
\fvset{frame=single}
\begin{pyglist}[language=python, caption={\acrlong{bt} connection example.},
	label={alg:rasp_bluetooth}, listingname={Algorithm}, numbers=left]
try:
    import bluetooth

    BT_address = '00:11:22:33:44:55'
    BT_port = 1

    BT_socket = bluetooth.BluetoothSocket(bluetooth.RFCOMM)
    BT_socket.connect((BT_address, BT_port))

    BT_available = True
except:
    BT_available = False
    print 'No bluetooth device is available'

class RoMIE:
    def _wait_ack(self):
        if not BT_available: return

        # read until ACK or NAK is read
        received = ''
        while 'ACK' not in received and 'NAK' not in received:
            received += BT_socket.recv(1024)
        if 'NAK' in received:
            pass

        return received

    def forward(self):
        if not BT_available: return 'Bluetooth error'

        BT_socket.send('F')
        response = self._wait_ack()
        return response
\end{pyglist}
\fvset{frame=none}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

The experiment server \acrshort{api} will have all the needed commands to use the experiment. For
the ones that need data being sent to the server, \acrshort{json} has been used (\acrlong{json}). It
is preferred over \acrshort{xml} (\acrlong{xml}) due to the higher compatibility of \acrshort{json}
and the more data-orientation of this \acrlong{rfc} or \acrshort{rfc}. This provides lower
overhead~\cite{xml_vs_json}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item ``\textbf{F}'', ``\textbf{L}'' and ``\textbf{R}'' commands, to move forward and turn left
	and right. The ``S'' command is not provided since the experiment does not require it and the
	robot will not drive towards a wall. The ``\textbf{F}'' will return a random question based on
	the current user's points.

	\item ``\textbf{CHECK\_REGISTER}'' command, to check if the user has been registered in the
	experiment before and decide if the experiment should show the registration form.

	\item ``\textbf{REGISTER}'' command, to send the registration data to the server and insert it
	into the SQLite database.

	\item ``\textbf{ANSWER}'' command, to send the answer given by the user to a question. It will
	return the new date for finishing the experiment and the new points for the user. These will not
	change if the answer was not correct.

	\item ``\textbf{FINISH}'' command, to finish the experiment and receive the final ranking.
\end{itemize}

Finally, the client will be developed using \acrshort{html} 5 (\acrlong{html} version 5),
\acrlong{js} (using JQuery library) and Bootstrap for a rapid development. It will use the WebLab
\acrlong{js} library to communicate with the experiment server. This library is an asynchronous
\acrshort{ajax} (\acrlong{ajax}) library that provides a simple interface to interact with
experiments. An example can be seen in algorithm~\ref{alg:weblab_lib}.

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{.9\textwidth}
\singlespace
\fvset{frame=single}
\begin{pyglist}[language=javascript, caption={WebLab \acrlong{js} library example.},
	label={alg:weblab_lib}, listingname={Algorithm}, numbers=left]
// Callback registration that will be
// called after reserving the experiment
Weblab.setOnStartInteractionCallback(start);

// Sending command to the experiment server
Weblab.sendCommand("L", function(response) {
    console.log("Good response: " + response);
}, function(response) {
    console.log("Bad response: " + response);
});
\end{pyglist}
\fvset{frame=none}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

The game logic is divided between the server and the client. Since the client is manipulable, all
the data is stored in the server and the game cannot be manipulated from client side. This logic
includes the point logic, which has a small bonus depending on when has the last correct answer been
given and the difficulty of the question. An example of this bonus calculation can be seen in the
algorithm~\ref{alg:point_bonus}. As that algorithm shows, the bonus will be a time bonus (the number
of seconds less than 30 since the last correct answer) divided by 5 and multiplied by the difficulty
of the question divided by 10. These bonuses have been adjusted after some trials where they have
been found to enable better gameplay.

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{.9\textwidth}
\singlespace
\fvset{frame=single}
\begin{pyglist}[language=python, caption={Point bonus calculation.},
	label={alg:point_bonus}, listingname={Algorithm}, numbers=left]
if correct:
    time_bonus = 30-(time.time()-self.last_correct)
    bonus = (self.q_difficulty/10+1)*
        (time_bonus/5 if time_bonus > 5 else 1)
    self.last_correct = time.time()
    self.points += self.question['points']*bonus
    self.finish_time += self.question['time']*bonus
\end{pyglist}
\fvset{frame=none}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

After the point calculation, the points in the database get updated. That way, if the user
disconnects from WebLab, or some other issue happens, the points will be saved. Only the best
score is saved. Moreover, and since that database is used for saving the data from the registration
form, which is provided by the user, prepared statements are used in order to avoid \acrshort{sql}
injection attacks.

The game configuration, containing all the questions with their bonuses, the \acrshort{rest}
\acrshort{api} server's \acrshort{ip} and port and all the needed configuration for the display such
as if it is a demonstration environment or needs to show some other client side experiment is stored
in a python file in the experiment server. That way, modifying questions or anything that could be
needed, such as creating debug experiments is managed with that simple configuration script, which
allows for scalability.

Furthermore, since this experiment uses a hardware resource (Romie, the robot), it could happen that
two users try to play with it at the same time. This is solved using the queue management provided
by WebLab. It is as simple as registering the resource's priority queue and WebLab will do all the
needed resource sharing management. Moreover, in the case of having two separate robots of the same
type, it would not be difficult to use the federation model and the user would end up in one of the
two robots transparently.

\subsection{Deployment Considerations}

The deployment must be done in WebLab-Deusto, a remote laboratory environment with three custom
networks and limited physical space. A simplified diagram of the network of WebLab-Deusto can be
seen in figure~\ref{fig:weblab-network}. As that figure shows, Plunder is the core server. It
provides access to WebLab-Deusto web environment and it provides most of the experiment servers. On
the other hand, Blood is the one working as a proxy for all the cameras in WebLab-Deusto, some of
them connected by Wi-Fi and others by Ethernet.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{fig/weblab-network}
	\caption{WebLab-Deusto network simplification.}\label{fig:weblab-network}
\end{figure}

In this case, since the use of \acrlong{bt} to connect our experiment server to the robot was a
requirement, and Plunder, Blood and WebLab-test should not receive any new hardware, a Raspberry Pi
Model B computer (figure~\ref{fig:rasp}) will be used, with a \acrshort{usb} (\acrlong{usb})
\acrlong{bt} dongle to connect to the robot and to provide a simple \acrshort{http} server with the
\acrshort{rest} \acrshort{api}. This small computer will be enough for such small web server, since
it provides 512~MB of \acrshort{ram}, a 700~Mhz \acrshort{arm} \acrshort{cpu}, 2 \acrshort{usb}
ports and an Ethernet port. All this in a small form factor, not bigger than a usual credit card,
and consuming only 3.5~W~\cite{rasp_b} of electrical power.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/rasp}
	\caption{Raspberry Pi model B computer.}
	\label{fig:rasp}
\end{figure}

This small computer will be connected via Ethernet to the WebLab network, while two cameras (the top
camera and the on-board camera) will be connected via Wi-Fi to WebLab camera network, using Blood as
the \acrshort{http} proxy server.

Finally, since the server software will change many times during the development, and Plunder must
be restarted for each change if the experiment server is located there, the experiment server for
this experiment will be located in WebLab-test. This way, there will be no need to restart Plunder
each time a new change is made to the experiment, giving higher availability to WebLab-Deusto.

In figure~\ref{fig:labyrinth_diagram} the location of the \acrshort{rfid} tags can be shown in a
scale model of the labyrinth. The labels are these ones, in order:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{A}: 4F:00:88:AB:CB
	\item \textbf{B}: 4F:00:56:A7:6F
	\item \textbf{C}: 4F:00:56:DA:57
	\item \textbf{D}: 4F:00:56:8F:86
	\item \textbf{E}: 4F:00:56:87:C4
	\item \textbf{F}: 50:00:8F:90:D5
	\item \textbf{G}: 4F:00:56:9F:08
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/labyrinth-diagram}
	\caption{The scale model of the labyrinth used in this project with the \acrshort{rfid} tags.}
	\label{fig:labyrinth_diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Testing Plan}

The testing for this software is divided in 3 main environments. First of all, the usual manual
testing is made by the developers and by the administrators of WebLab-Deusto. This showed many bugs
that they were fixed almost as soon as they appeared, but in any case, this is not enough for a
production environment.

After the manual testing, WebLab-Deusto has a \acrlong{ci} system connected to Travis \acrshort{ci}
in GitHub. It provides many unit tests that provide stability to the code, since the developers
receive emails when a commit does not pass the tests. Nevertheless, for the \acrlong{gui}
(\acrshort{gui}), it is difficult to provide unit tests.

Finally, and also as a demonstration of the potential of the project, the project was tested in an
event at the University of Deusto called ForoTech~\cite{forotech}. In this event the project was
tested in a high load environment, where the robot received hundreds of uses in a short period of
time, demonstrating the reliability and also showing some small issues that were soon fixed.

\subsection{User Manual}

For using Romie, you must have an account in WebLab-Deusto and the appropriate permissions to use
the experiment. Once you fulfill those requirements, go to
\url{https://weblab.deusto.es/weblab/client/}. In that page (figure~\ref{fig:man:weblab}), you will
be able to insert your credentials in the login form and log in.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fig/manuals/weblab}
	\caption{WebLab Deusto's landing page.}
	\label{fig:man:weblab}
\end{figure}

Once logged in, you will see ``romie'' experiment under the ``Robot experiments'' category
(figure~\ref{fig:man:romie_weblab}). You could see more experiments if you have the permission to
use them. If you cannot find the experiment you should contact with the administrators. Click on
``romie'' or in its image and you will enter the reservation page
(figure~\ref{fig:man:romie_reserve}). There, you can reserve the experiment clicking the ``Reserve''
button.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{fig/manuals/trivial/romie-weblab}
	\caption{Romie under ``Robot experiments'' in WebLab Deusto.}
	\label{fig:man:romie_weblab}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/manuals/trivial/romie-reserve}
	\caption{Romie reservation screen.}
	\label{fig:man:romie_reserve}
\end{figure}

Once reserved, on the first use, you will see the registration form
(figure~\ref{fig:man:romie_register}). You will have to fill it in order to play the game. There is
also a version without the registration screen if you only want to test the robot, ask the
administrators for permission to use it. After filling the registration form  with your own data,
you can click the register button. \emph{Note: the experiment is prepared to work with students of
less than 18 years old, so any age above that or below 5 years old is considered an input error,
that will be notified in the \acrlong{ui}}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{fig/manuals/trivial/romie-register}
	\caption{Romie's registration form.}
	\label{fig:man:romie_register}
\end{figure}

After the registration, you will be able to play with Romie. The game is pretty easy to use: you
will have three arrows in the left control pad (figure~\ref{fig:man:romie_start}), where you will be
able to click and command the robot to move forward or to turn left or right. Moreover, you will
have the on-board camera to see what the robot does. If you press forward against a wall do not
worry, the robot will not collide.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{fig/manuals/trivial/romie-start}
	\caption{Playing with Romie.}
	\label{fig:man:romie_start}
\end{figure}

If you fall in top of a card, you will be asked a question (figure~\ref{fig:man:romie_question}). If
you answer correctly, you will be given points and more time to continue playing. Furthermore, you
will have the opportunity to manually activate the ceiling camera to see all the labyrinth and
decide where to go (figure~\ref{fig:man:romie_ceiling}).

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{fig/manuals/trivial/romie-question}
	\caption{Romie asks you questions when you drive onto a card.}
	\label{fig:man:romie_question}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

	\caption{You can activate the ceiling camera when you answer a question correctly.}
	\label{fig:man:romie_ceiling}
\end{figure}

Finally, when the time finishes, you will see a ranking with the 10 best scores of the game (less if
there has not been enough users) with your user selected in green if you are in the top ten, as you
can see in figure~\ref{fig:man:romie_ranking}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

	\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{fig/manuals/trivial/romie-ranking}
	\caption{The final ranking where you can see the best scores.}
	\label{fig:man:romie_ranking}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Issue Management}

During the development some issues have been faced, which had to be solved. One of the first issues
that appeared was that the robot was not reading the lines properly, mainly the ones in the
intersections. That was caused because the contrast between the line and the background was
insufficient. It was solved by painting all the labyrinth in white and painting the black lines.
That way there was no need for using tape and the robot started to work properly.

Other issue that came across was that the robot did not read the \acrshort{rfid} tags every time it
went on top of them. The problem was that the \acrshort{rfid} reader the robot had, the ID-12 seemed
to have some defect, since the reader was located about 10-15~mm from the floor and its range was of
120~mm~\cite{rfid}. It was decided to change it by a ID-20 reader, that has a 180~mm
range~\cite{rfid} and worked perfectly.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=0.35\textheight]{fig/lines}
	\caption{Romie must not get entangled with the walls.}
	\label{fig:lines}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, the electricity was another problem: the robot was using batteries, and as it can be
seen above, it had to be changed to cables. The main issue was that the cables could get entangled
with the walls. It was solved by extending a flexible artifact in top of the robot
(figure~\ref{fig:lines}).

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{.9\textwidth}
\singlespace
\fvset{frame=single}
\begin{pyglist}[language=c, caption={Arduino code for returning if wall was hit.},
	label={alg:romie_wall}, listingname={Algorithm}, numbers=left]
if (millis()-lastTimeFollow >= 8000) {
    while(digitalRead(FLIline) == HIGH) Motors.turnRight(100);
    while(digitalRead(FRIline) == LOW) Motors.turnRight(100);
    FollowLine();
    lastTimeFollow=millis();
}
\end{pyglist}
\fvset{frame=none}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

Finally, there was a problem with the wall sensor, since it would disconnect sometimes. This was a
hardware issue that could not be solved easily, since the sensor would arrive at least 1 month after
being requested. Taking that into account it was decided to implement a software solution directly
in the robot so that it would go back automatically if something went wrong, as it can be seen in
algorithm~\ref{alg:romie_wall}.

\subsection{Labpsico Experiment Integration}

When the trivial type game was almost finished, there was an opportunity to work with Deusto's
psychology laboratory, Labpsico. They proposed to integrate an experiment they had with this game,
so that users could perform their activity before playing.

This experiment had been developed by Helena Matute's team, recently prized by the Jot Down
magazine~\cite{jotdown_helena} by one of her works. The experiment consists on clicking in 40 cards
and looking on the other side of them. Randomly, a mark can appear in one or both sides of the card
(figure~\ref{subfig:labpsico_card_mark}) and users should be able to determine if there is
correlation between the two marks.

After that, the users will be divided into two groups: test users and control users. This way, using
the blind experiment technique, they will show some random information to the control group and
information about medicine effectiveness to the test group. Then they will repeat the experiment
using some other cards but with the same randomness.

Comparing both experiments Labpsico will get the real knowledge of how did the experience change
their minds about not proven science or \emph{pseudoscience}. After that, a score will be given to
the user that will be added to the game (figure~\ref{fig:labpsico_romie}).

For the integration of this experiment, and since it has been developed using Bootstrap, there is no
need on changing its style. Moreover, there were tight style requirements from the Labpsico team, so
this could not be changed easily. That is why only some of the libraries have been modified to take
benefit from the ones already used in WebLab and to lower the number of downloads per request.
Finally, a simple \emph{iframe} \acrshort{html} element has been used to show the experiment inside
the Bootstrap's \emph{modal} element. The data is sent to Labpsico directly using the web interface,
using an on-line database in FireBase~\cite{firebase}. This experiment will only appear once per
each user.
