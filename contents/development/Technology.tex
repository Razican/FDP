\section{Technology}

In this section the technology and tools used for this project will be analyzed. The technology has
been divided between hardware and software, since in this project, both aspects have had big impact.

\subsection{Hardware}

In this case, the hardware has been divided in mainly two parts. First of all, the hardware used by
the robot itself, has been the Arduino Uno microcontroller (figure~\ref{fig:arduino_board}. This
microcontroller provides the ATmega328 microcontroller with 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog
inputs and a \acrshort{usb} connector~\cite{arduino_datasheet}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=0.3\textheight]{fig/arduino-board}
	\caption{Arduino Uno microcontroler.}
	\label{fig:arduino_board}
\end{figure}

The hardware attached to the Arduino Uno is mainly the same it had when the project started. A
\emph{E18-D80NK} infrared adjustable sensor for wall sensing, \emph{MSE-S110.2} sensors for
following the line, a \emph{Grove Line Finder} for detecting intersections, a
\emph{\acrshort{bt} Board v1.02} \acrlong{bt} adapter for \acrlong{bt} communication~\cite{fdp_itu}.
The \acrshort{rfid} reader, on the other hand, and as it has ben shown before, has been changed by
an ID-20~\cite{rfid} sensor, since the ID-12 the robot had was not working properly.

For the \acrshort{http} server, a Raspberry Pi model B has been used. The reason for not using the
model B+ or the Raspberry Pi 2 model B has been that there already was an unused Raspberry Pi model
B in WebLab-Deusto, and this hardware was powerful enough to provide the services needed by this
project. This computer has been used as a client connected via \acrlong{bt} to the robot and as a
server connected via Ethernet to the WebLab-Deusto network. Raspberry Pi foundation
(figure~\ref{fig:rasp_logo}) develops these tiny computers to teach kids about computers and
programming in a very affordable way, so it seemed a reasonable choice for this project.

	\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{fig/rasp-logo}
	\caption{Raspberry Pi logo.}
	\label{fig:rasp_logo}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Software}

In this project, since many hardware and software technologies have been integrated, many software
platforms and languages have been used. Some of them were new, while others were known. The core
functionality of the project has been developed in \acrlong{js} for the client side and
Python~\cite{python_web} for the server side.

The choice for the client side was simple, since \acrlong{js} is the only language natively
supported by all web browsers. Nevertheless, since there was a need to fasten the development,
JQuery~\cite{jquery_web} library has been used (figure~\ref{subfig:jquery}), as well as
Bootstrap~\cite{bootstrap_web} framework. JQuery gives some useful features to work with the
\acrshort{dom} and to perform \acrshort{ajax} requests, even if those last ones have been
implemented using the WebLab \acrshort{api}, since the commands had to be sent through to the WebLab
server.

	\end{subfigure}\quad
	\caption{Helpers used in the client side of the project.}
\end{figure}

Bootstrap, the framework developed by Twitter, (figure~\ref{subfig:bootstrap}) has been used for a
better representation of the \acrlong{ui}, since it comes with built-in \acrshort{css} style
sheets that give great appearance and allow for responsive web design, even if the current WebLab
client is not responsive. Nevertheless, the software is prepared for future responsiveness of the
WebLab client.

One of the decisions to make was which version of JQuery to use, since all major browsers are
supported by this library's version 2, but as it often happens, Microsoft's Internet Explorer prior
to version 9 is not supported~\cite{jquery_versions}. Finally version 2 has been used, since the
traffic in WebLab Deusto using that browser was low.

The data representation in the client has been done with \acrshort{html}5~\cite{html5_spec}
(figure~\ref{subfig:html5}). This new version of \acrshort{html} provides many useful features in
forms that have been used for the registration, as well as great integration with \acrshort{css} 3
that has been used for some styling. \acrshort{css} 3 comes with new selectors~\cite{css3_sel} and
useful functions that provide much of the functionality originally only available through
\acrlong{js}, which gave bigger overhead than \acrshort{css}.

For the communication between the client and the server, the WebLab \acrshort{api} has been used for
sending commands using \acrshort{json}. Nevertheless, in the case of the visual programming mode,
Google Blockly has been used, which has a built in blocks to \acrshort{xml} converter, and that has
been used to save programs before and after the experiment reservation.

On the other hand, the communication between the WebLab server and the Raspberry Pi with the small
\acrshort{http} server providing access to the robot has been done using a \acrshort{rest}
\acrshort{api} in the server, developed in Python, that has been used by the WebLab server to send
commands to the robot.

The WebLab server side has been programmed using Python (figure~\ref{fig:python}). The main reason
has been that the WebLab \acrshort{api} is being developed actively mainly for Python, and it has
a better integration, since WebLab itself is developed in Python. Moreover, Python is an adequate
language for a development like this, since it does not have much overhead and it allows a rapid
development. An example of the WebLab \acrshort{api} can be seen in
algorithm~\ref{alg:weblab_server_api}.

As it can be seen in algorithm~\ref{alg:weblab_server_api}, WebLab has some built-in methods for the
experiment \acrshort{api}. This gives the option of easily and rapidly developing laboratories for
WebLab. Since this \acrshort{api} is developed in Python 2, Python 3 has not been used. Python 3 is
a mayor release that is not backwards compatible, so, for backwards compatibility reasons, both, the
WebLab server script and the \acrshort{rest} \acrshort{api} script have been developed in Python 2.

\section{Tools}

\subsection{Code Editor}

For developing this project, some tools have been used. These tools will be analyzed here so that
the reason for their use can be understood.

The first tool used has been the code editor. The editor used has been Sublime
Text~\cite{sublime_web}. Version 2 has been used until March 2015, where development in version 3
gave life signs and it was decided to upgrade to this beta version. There are also multiple
\acrshort{ide}s such as PyCharm~\cite{pycharm_web}, Eclipse~\cite{eclipse_web} or other editors such
as Atom~\cite{atom_web}, Lime Text~\cite{lime_web} or Microsoft Visual Studio
Code~\cite{ms_code_web}. There are also other console tools like Vim~\cite{vim_web},
Nano~\cite{nano_web} or Emacs~\cite{emacs_web}.

Nevertheless, even if one of the goals of the project was to work with as much open source software
as possible, the truth is that currently, the closed sourced ones offer better performance. For
instance, Atom tries to be the open source alternative to Sublime Text, but it starts really slowly
and the plug-ins for Sublime Text can be found for almost every situation, while such a big plug-in
repository does not exist for Atom. Lime Text might outperform Sublime Text in the future, but
currently it is still in an unstable release. Microsoft Visual Studio Code, on the other hand, was
released later this year and it did not have any benefits with respect to Sublime Text, so it was
worthless changing the editor at this point.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{0.35\textwidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{fig/sublime}
		\caption{Sublime Text logo.}\label{subfig:sublime}
	\end{subfigure}\quad
	\begin{subfigure}{0.55\textwidth}

		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/arduino-community}
		\caption{Arduino Community logo. \emph{Source: Arduino}}\label{subfig:arduino_community}
	\end{subfigure}\quad
	\caption{Code editors used.}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, \acrshort{ide}s are big softwares that from my point of view interfere in the
programming process. In the end, this is about feeling comfortable with the tool, and the velocity
and simplicity offered by editors outperform \acrshort{ide}s greatly. That is why the tool used for
all the programming (except the Arduino script) has been Sublime Text 3
(figure~\ref{subfig:sublime}).

Nevertheless, since the robot's microcontroller is an Arduino, the Arduino
\acrshort{ide}~\cite{arduino_ide} (figure~\ref{subfig:arduino_community}) has been used to program
the robot itself, since it is simple and easy to use for this simple task. For some specific
situations such as small testing changes made in the project's Raspberry Pi or testing server
configuration Nano has been used since it provides a simple console interface easy to use when
connecting via \acrshort{ssh} (\acrlong{ssh}).

\subsection{User Interface Testing}

Since one of the key points of the project has been the \acrlong{ui} and in overall the web client
of the system, this needed to be tested. For this task, two main web browsers have been used:
Mozilla Firefox~\cite{firefox_web} (figure~\ref{subfig:firefox}) and Google Chrome~\cite{chrome_web}
(figure~\ref{subfig:chrome}). Here, it has been found that Google Chrome's developer tools have
helped the development more, thanks to their features and ease of use. A screenshot of Google
Chrome's developer tools can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:chrome_dev}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Operating System and Tools}

For the development, the \acrlong{os} used has been Ubuntu \acrshort{gnome}~\cite{ubuntu_gnome_web}
(figure~\ref{subfig:ubuntu_gnome}). This distribution gives all the needed productivity and user
friendliness. The \acrlong{ui} used has been \acrshort{gnome} Shell, and as far as possible, it has
been tried to use only \acrshort{floss} software (\acrlong{floss}).

Moreover, for the server environments two main operating systems have been used: Ubuntu
Server~\cite{ubuntu_web} (figure~\ref{subfig:ubuntu}) and Raspbian~\cite{raspbian_web}, the
Raspberry Pi \acrshort{arm} compatible Debian~\cite{debian_web} distribution
(figure~\ref{subfig:debian}). The first of the two has been used for main WebLab-Deusto servers. It
is used due to its user friendliness, even if being a \acrshort{cli} (\acrlong{cli}). The second one
has been used due to its compatibility with the hardware being used for the project, the Raspberry
Pi computer.

		\caption{Debian logo.}\label{subfig:debian}
	\end{subfigure}\quad
	\caption{Operating systems used in this project.}
\end{figure}

In all cases, the communication between the various servers has been done via \acrshort{ssh}, since
it provides an easy interface with the consoles of the servers.

\subsection{Version Control}

For the version control of the project, Git~\cite{git_web} has been used (figure~\ref{subfig:git}).
Git is a distributed \acrlong{vcs} or \acrshort{vcs} created by Linus Torvalds to improve the Linux
kernel development. It allows having repositories distributed without a need of a central
repository. Nevertheless, GitHub~\cite{github_web} is the service used by WebLab-Deusto for the Git
hosting as well as for issue tracking since GitHub provides with a simple issue management
interface, with simple and effective pull requests integrated with the code and commits.
